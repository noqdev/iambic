## Installing IAMbic and Supported Versions

IAMbic is available on PyPI:

```console
python -m pip install iambic-core
```

IAMbic officially supports Python 3.9+.

### Template Examples

Here are some examples showcasing IAMbic's capabilities:

#### AWS Multi-Account Cloudwatch Role

Create a Cloudwatch role with static permissions across three accounts, dynamically generating role names based on the account the role is deployed to. This template would result in the creation of three roles: "dev_cloudwatch",
"staging_cloudwatch", and "prod_cloudwatch" on the respective AWS accounts.

See the [Getting Started guide for AWS](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/aws), the AWS IAM Role section of our [Example Templates repository](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic-templates-examples/blob/main/resources/aws/iam/role/all_accounts/account_name_iambic_test_role.yaml), and our [blog post on multi-account roles](https://www.noq.dev/blog/aws-permission-bouncers-letting-loose-in-dev-keeping-it-tight-in-prod) for more information.

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
identifier: '{{var.account_name}}_cloudwatch'
included_accounts:
    - dev
    - staging
    - prod

            - logs:GetLogRecord
            - logs:GetQueryResults
            - logs:TestMetricFilter
            - logs:FilterLogEvents
            - logs:StartQuery

```

### AWS Dynamic Permissions

Create a BackendDeveloperRole with varying permissions based on the AWS account. See the [Getting Started guide for AWS](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/aws) for more information.

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
identifier: '{{var.account_name}}_backend_developer'
included_accounts:
  - '*'
excluded_accounts:
  - compliance
properties:
  description:
    - description: Backend developer role for {{var.account_name}}
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action:
          - sts:AssumeRole
          - sts:TagSession
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          aws: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ExampleRole
    version: '2012-10-17'
  inline_policies:
    - policy_name: s3_policy
      statement:
        - # Policy applies to role on all accounts except `customer_data`.
          excluded_accounts:
            - customer_data
          effect: allow
          action:
              - s3:GetObject
              - s3:ListObject
          resource:
              - "*"
          condition:
            StringNotEquals:
                s3:ResourceTag/sensitive: 'true'
        - # Allow write access to non-sensitive resources on the dev account
          included_accounts:
            - dev
          effect: allow
          action:
              - s3:PutObject
          resource:
              - "*"
          condition:
                StringNotEquals:
                    s3:ResourceTag/sensitive: 'true'
  role_name: '{{var.account_name}}_backend_developer'
  tags:
    - key: owner
      value: devops
```

### AWS Identity Center (SSO) Permission Sets

Create an AWS Identity Center (SSO) permission set with varying permissions based on the AWS account. See the [Getting Started guide for AWS](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/aws), the AWS IC/SSO Permission Set section of our [Example Templates repository](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic-templates-examples/blob/main/resources/aws/identity_center/permission_set/design.yaml), and our blog post on [Tailoring AWS Identity Center (SSO) Permissions Per Account with IAMbic](https://www.noq.dev/blog/tailor-aws-identity-center-sso-permissions-per-account-with-iambic) for more information.

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IdentityCenter::PermissionSet
access_rules:
  - expires_at: 2028-05-19T14:17 UTC
    groups:
      - engineering
identifier: design
properties:
  name: design
  customer_managed_policy_references:
    - name: base_deny
  inline_policy:
    statement:
      - action:
          - ec2:list*
        effect: Deny
        resource:
          - '*'
      - action:
          - ec2:list*
        effect: Deny
        expires_at: 2033-05-19T14:17 UTC
        resource:
          - '*'
  managed_policies:
    - arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSHealthFullAccess
  permissions_boundary:
    customer_managed_policy_reference:
      name: base_permission_boundary
  session_duration: PT4H
  tags:
    - key: owner
      value: design@example.com
```

### Okta Application Assignments

Manage Okta application assignments, including expiration dates for specific users. See the [Getting Started guide for Okta](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/okta) for more information.

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::App
idp_name: development
properties:
  name: Salesforce.com
  assignments:
    - user: username@example.com
    - user: username2@example.com
    - user: username3@example.com
      expires_at: 2023-09-01T00:00 UTC
  status: ACTIVE
```

### AWS Service Control Policies

Managing access to AWS services can be a tricky business. That's where Service Control Policies (SCPs) come in. SCPs allow you to define what services and actions are accessible within your AWS accounts. With IAMbic, you can import your existing SCPs, create new ones that restrict access to specific AWS services, and prevent any drift from occurring to ensure that you're protecting sensitive information the way you intend.

For instance, let's say you want to limit access to certain AWS regions. You can create an SCP that denies access to all regions except those you specify. This can be particularly useful if you're looking to maintain tighter control over your data residency and compliance.

Here's an example of how you can set this up:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::Organizations::SCP
account_id: '123456789012'
iambic_managed: enforced
identifier: RestrictRegions
org_id: o-123456
properties:
  policy_document:
    statement:
      - condition:
          StringNotEquals:
            aws:RequestedRegion:
              - us-east-1
              - us-west-2
        effect: Deny
        not_action:
          - a4b:*
          - budgets:*
          - ce:*
          - chime:*
          - cloudfront:*
          - cur:*
          - globalaccelerator:*
          - health:*
          - iam:*
          - importexport:*
          - mobileanalytics:*
          - organizations:*
          - route53:*
          - route53domains:*
          - shield:*
          - support:*
          - trustedadvisor:*
          - waf:*
          - wellarchitected:*
        resource:
          - '*'
  policy_name: RestrictRegions
  targets:
    roots:
      - r-123
```

In this example, the SCP named `RestrictRegions` denies access to all AWS regions except `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`. It also excludes certain global services from the restriction.

For more information on how to get started with AWS and SCPs, check out our [Getting Started guide for AWS](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/aws) and the [AWS SCP Section of our Example Templates repository](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic-templates-examples/blob/main/resources/aws/organizations/scp/iambic_test_org_account/restrict_regions.yaml).
