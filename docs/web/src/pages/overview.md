# Introduction to Iambic

IAMbic is an open-source language that simplifies the process of monitoring and managing Cloud IAM for AWS, Okta, and Google. The core objectives of Iambic are as follows:

1. Allow users to easily understand and manage human and cloud identities, as well as their permissions, in one place.
2. Provide breakglass and JIT access to cloud identities
3. Change access and permissions with a single pull request
4. Round-trip configurations from Cloud to Config at any time

... All without hiding behind a proprietary vendor database.

## Supported Integrations

Iambic currently integrates with AWS, Okta, and Google.

For AWS, Noq supports AWS permission sets and IAM roles
