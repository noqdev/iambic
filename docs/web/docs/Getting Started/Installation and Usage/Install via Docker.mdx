## Running the IAMbic docker container locally

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following tools installed on your system:

* Docker

If you don't have these tools installed, follow the instructions below:

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Steps

> Note: for instructions on how to use IAMbic, reference [Using IAMbic](./Using.mdx)

To run the docker container locally, you can use the docker command:

Basic run:

    docker run public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest <command>

We recommend mounting a local volume for the templates that are imported:

    docker run -p 3000:3000 -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v <local_dir>:/templates public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest <command>

Optionally you can store the volume in your system's docker context:

    docker run -p 3000:3000 -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v /templates public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest <command>

> Bonus:
> If you want to browse this documentation locally, you can start the self-contained http server within the container using the `doc_serve` command: `run -v /templates public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest doc_serve`. Then browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Shortcut

We recommend that you add the following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile:

```bash
alias iambic="docker run -p 3000:3000 -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v /templates public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest"
```

That way you can just execute iambic seamlessly as an application within your system:

    iambic import

## Installing the IAMbic docker container with your Github Actions

You can automate your workflows by installing the IAMbic docker container with your Github Actions flow.

Reference [IAMbic on Github](../Github/Github.mdx) for more information.

## Building the IAMbic docker container

You can also build your own IAMbic docker container by cloning the IAMbic repo and following the below steps:

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need to have the following tools installed on your system:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

If you don't have these tools installed, follow the instructions below:

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps

#### Clone the IAMbic repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noqdev/iambic.git
```

#### Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd iambic/
```

```bash
docker build -t your-username/project-name:tag .
```

Replace your-username/project-name:tag with the name you want to give your Docker image. For example, johnsmith/my-project:v1.0.0. The . at the end of the command specifies that the Dockerfile is located in the current directory.

#### Test the Docker image.

Run the following command to start a Docker container using the image you just built:

```bash
docker run your-username/project-name:tag <command>
```

This command starts the container using the Docker image you just built.

You should be able to start the documentation server by typing: `docker run your-username/project-name:tag doc_serve`. Then try to access this documentation resource on http://localhost:3000.

#### Push the Docker image to Docker Hub or a private repository.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a popular registry for storing and sharing Docker images. If you don't have a Docker Hub account, sign up for one.

Alternatively, publish the docker image to a repository of your choice.

If you choose to store the docker image in docker hub...

Login:

```bash
docker login
```

This command will prompt you to enter your Docker Hub username and password.

Once you're logged in, run the following command to push the Docker image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push your-username/project-name:tag
```

This command uploads the Docker image to Docker Hub, where it can be accessed by other users.
