## Using IAMbic

Once IAMbic is installed on your system, you can use it. Generally there are three major modes of operation:

1. Plan: an operation to dry-run a particular permission set without applying it; this is a great method to test how IAMbic will mutate your environment before applying the changes.
1. Apply: applies the permission set changes by mutating your environment. This operation requires *read/write* rights to your cloud environment.
1. Import: reads and stores your current environment on disk in IAMbic configuration files. Generally you start here to download all your current roles and their permissions.

Execute IAMbic by running the `iambic` command: `iambic <command>`

Where **<command\>** is one of:
* apply: generates and executes an execution plan for the specified Iambic templates; using this command you can apply the changes as specified in the templates.
* config-discovery: pull in provider config related changes like a new AWS account being added to an org.
* git-apply: similar to `apply`, but only considers changes from the currently checkout branch compared to origin/main.
* git-plan: similar to `plan` (see below), but only considers changes from the currently checkout branch compared to origin/main.
* import: updates your repo with the current state of all providers defined in your config. This includes adding, updating, and removing templates.
* plan: similar to `apply`, but shows the execution plan for the specified Iambic templates without executing; using this command you can get an idea of what changes would be made to the system.
* setup: launch the configuration wizard
* doc-serve: starts the documentation server on port 3000; you can then view this documentation when browsing to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) locally
