## Overview
IAMbic's GitHub integration is designed to facilitate team collaboration on IAMbic templates.
This page will walk you through the steps of configuring IAMbic, GitHub, and AWS to work together.

### Compatible versions of Github

 * GitHub Free
 * GitHub Team
 * Github Enterprise Cloud

### The typical workflow for using IAMbic with GitHub

![IAMbic Git Flow](/img/git/iambic_git_flow.png)

1. Developer Alice wants to create an application role. She creates a different branch, makes her changes, and submits a pull request with her changes to the IAMbic templates repository.
2. Once the PR is created, the IAMbic GitHub action will run `iambic plan --git-aware` to calculate the changes required due to the PR, and submits the proposed changes back into the PR as a comment.
3. Reviewer Bob will review the template changes along with the proposed_changes. Bob may request additional changes.
4. Optional: Developer Alice updates the PR. The IAMbic GitHub action will run `iambic plan --git-aware` again to calculate the new changes required.
5. Reviewer Bob approves the PR.
6. Developer Alice comments with `iambic apply` in the PR.
7. The IAMbic GitHub action will apply the changes in the PR.
8. Once git-apply is successful, the GitHub action will close the pull request.

## Setting up GitHub and AWS to work with IAMbic

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to do the following:

1. Complete the [IAMbic Getting Started guide](/getting_started/) to create your Git repository and import your existing identities and
permissions from your cloud provider(s).
2. Set up a GitHub repository for your IAMbic templates.
3. Make sure you have admin access for the IAMbic GitHub repository that can perform the following tasks:
	1. Configure the repository to require approvals before Merging Pull Requests.
	2. Add GitHub Apps
4. Have an AWS admin configure federated login <!-- #TODO link to how to configure federated login --> for IAMbic GitHub actions.

#### Configure your GitHub Repository to require approvals before merging

1. Go to the GitHub repository you had created previously, `ExampleOrg/iambic-templates`
2. Navigate to Repository Settings, in the left navigation menu to "Branches" settings page; the URL will look something like `github.com/ExampleOrg/iambic-templates/settings/branches`

![IAMbic Git Flow](/img/git/github-settings-menu.png)

3. Add a branch protection rule.
4. Set the branch name pattern to `main`.
5. Configure the options
	1. Enable "Require a pull request before merging".
	1. Enable "Require Approvals".
	1. Leave the default value for "Required number of approvals".
	1. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging". <!-- #TODO Is there a reason the prior 3 settings were on one line and this was on it's own line?  -->


# GitHub App integration

By installing IAMbic GitHub App, the app can integrate the pull-request and merge flow in your iambic templates repository.

### Create a GitHub App in your organization

1. Visit your Organization's GitHub App settings. The path is `Settings > Developer Settings > New GitHub App`. Navigation URL will look like `github.com/organizations/ExampleOrg/settings/apps`
	1. You need to have Settings Permission over the Organization
2. Click "New GitHub App"
3. Input `Iambic Integrations` for "GitHub App name".
4. Input `https://docs.iambic.org/` for "Homepage URL".
5. Uncheck "Active" for "Webhook".
6. Configure Permissions
	1. Select "Read and Write" for "Content" Under "Repository/Permissions".
	2. Select "Read and Write" for "Issues" Under "Repository/Permissions".
	3. Select "Read and Write" for "Pull requests" Under "Repository/Permissions".
9. Leave the default value ("Only on this account") for "Where can this GitHub App be installed?".
10. Click "Create GitHub App".
11. Scroll down to "Private Keys".
12. Click "Generate a private key".
13. The private key should be downloaded automatically.

### Store the following secrets in AWS Secrets Manager in the same AWS account running GitHub App lambda function.

1. Go to AWS Secret Manager, the URL will look like `console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/listsecrets`.
	1. Consider check the region, the default used in the Terraform is `us-west-2`.
1. Store the earlier downloaded private key contents (not the filename) in AWS Secrets Manager and name it `iambic/github-app-private-key`.
	1. This is the default name used in the Terraform that will be executed later. If you use another name, be sure to update it in the Terraform procedure later.

<!-- # TODO: Mention plaintext etc. -->

2. Generate a webhook secret by taking the output of one of these commands:
	1. `ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'`at the terminal.
	1. `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(20))"`
	1. `node -e "var token = require('crypto').randomBytes(20).toString('hex'); console.log(token)"`
3. Store the webhook secret in AWS Secrets Manager and name it `iambic/github-app-webhook-secret`.

### Create an IAM role for Lambda function execution
<!-- # TODO: Where do I put this file and how do I write it? -->

1. Place the above IAMbic template to your `iambic-templates` repo under `resources/github/iam_role_lambda.yaml`

<!-- for us, NAME_OF_AWS_ACCOUNT_THAT_HAS_IambicHubRole should be aws_hub_account_name -->
```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
included_accounts:
  # You will need to replace the "NAME_OF_AWS_ACCOUNT_THAT_HAS_IambicHubRole"
  # with the account name of the AWS account holding the IambicHubRole.
  # In the event you change the secret names, you need to update those values as well.
  - NAME_OF_AWS_ACCOUNT_THAT_HAS_IambicHubRole
identifier: iambic_github_app_lambda_execution
properties:
  description: Github App Lambda Execution
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action: sts:AssumeRole
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          service: lambda.amazonaws.com
    version: '2012-10-17'
  inline_policies:
    - policy_name: github-app
      statement:
        - action:
            - logs:CreateLogGroup
          effect: Allow
          resource:
            - "arn:aws:logs:*:{{var.account_id}}:log-group:*:log-stream:"
          sid: CreateLogGroup
        - action:
            - secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
          effect: Allow
          resource:
            - arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:{{var.account_id}}:secret:iambic/github-app-private-key
            - arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:{{var.account_id}}:secret:iambic/github-app-private-key-*
            - arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:{{var.account_id}}:secret:iambic/github-app-webhook-secret
            - arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:{{var.account_id}}:secret:iambic/github-app-webhook-secret-*
          sid: SecretReading
        - action:
            - logs:CreateLogStream
            - logs:PutLogEvents
          effect: Allow
          resource:
            - arn:aws:logs:*:{{var.account_id}}:log-group:/aws/lambda/iambic_github_app_webhook*:*
          sid: LogEvents
        - action: sts:AssumeRole
          effect: Allow
          resource: arn:aws:iam::{{var.account_id}}:role/IambicHubRole
      version: '2012-10-17'
  role_name: iambic_github_app_lambda_execution
```
2. You can then apply the template via `iambic apply resources/github/iam_role_lambda.yaml`
3. Allow the `iambic_github_app_lambda_execution` to assume to `IambicHubRole` in the organization management account.

```diff
properties:
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
+      - action:
+          - sts:AssumeRole
+          - sts:TagSession
+        effect: Allow
+        principal:
+          aws: arn:aws:iam::{{var.account_id}}:role/iambic_github_app_lambda_execution
```

Update the IambicHubRole by running `iambic apply <path-to-iambic-hub-role-of-mgmt-account>`

### Deploy the GitHub App as a Lambda Function

You have created the GitHub App. A GitHub App has to be a hosted application. Now, it will be deployed as a lambda function through a Terraform script.

1. Remember to set your `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable with your AWS account.
2. [Checkout iambic repository](/reference/installation/install_iambic_via_the_repo#checkout-the-iambic-repository).
3. `cd deployment/github_app`
4. `terraform init`
5. `terraform apply` (Examine the plan, it is the resources it will create). Enter `yes` if you accept the plan to continue.
6. `terraform output` will contain the lambda function URL. this is the URL to be used for the GitHub app webhook.

### Connect the GitHub App to the Lambda Function

Return to the GitHub App settings page to connect the GitHub App to the Lambda that was just deployed.

1. Go to `https://github.com/organizations/ExampleOrg/settings/apps/iambic-integrations`
2. Ensure you are in the "General" section in the left navigation bar.
3. Scroll down to "Webhook" section.
	1. Paste in the url from the lambda function URL. (e.g. "https://UNIQUE_ID.lambda-url.us-west-2.on.aws/").
	2. Paste in the Webhook secret generated earlier.
	3. Click "Save changes".
7. Click "Permissions & events" section in the left navigation bar.
	1. Scroll down to "Subscribe to events".
	2. Ensure the following are selected: "Meta", "Issue Comment", "Pull request", and "Workflow run".
	3. Click "Save changes".
11. Click "Install App" in the left navigation bar.
12. Click "Install" for your organization.
13. Go to your organization settings (https://github.com/organizations/ExampleOrg/settings/profile).
14. Select "GitHub Apps" under "Third-party Access" in the left navigation bar.
15. Click "Configure" on "Iambic Integrations".
16. Select your IAMbic templates repository under "Repository access" section.
17. Click Save.

### Enable iambic-integrations to bypass review rules for "main" branch

Typical pull-requests review flow requires reviewers approval. Action such as auto import, auto expire require changes being pushed back into main branch without manual approvals.

1. Go to your iambic templates repository settings (https://github.com/ExampleOrg/ExampleIambicTemplatesRepository/settings).
2. Click "Branches" in the top left navigation.
3. Click on "Edit" for "main" under "Branch protection rules".
4. Click on "Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests".
5. In "Search for people, teams or apps", type in `iambic-integrations` to click on the GitHub App we have created.
6. Click "Save changes".


### Finish setting up your local repo


#### Open a pull request on your iambic-template repo

1. `git checkout -b task/change_description origin/main`
2. Edit one of your description within your templates, like `resources/github/iam_role_lambda.yaml`. <!-- #TODO edit to what?? -->
3. Add your changes to your branch, and push it to github:
	```bash
	git add resources/github/iam_role_lambda.yaml
	git commit -m "Change Description"
	git push origin HEAD
	```
4. Create a pull request.
5. The installed GitHub App will comment with plan the changes. Any time you want iambic github action to re-plan the changes, you can comment `iambic plan`.
6. The plan will be a comment in line, as long as it is less than 65kb. (Be very careful with big plans because those are difficult for reviewers to review.) <!-- #TODO So then what? What's the alternative? -->
7. Add reviewers to review your PR and plan that is in the PR comments.
8. Once your reviewer approves your changes, add comment `iambic apply` to have iambic apply the changes. If the changes can be successfully applied, the PR will be automatically merged into main as well.

## FAQ

1. After I've deployed the Docker as a Lambda function, how do I update it?

  A: To update the Docker image used for the Lambda function, you simply need to run `terraform apply` again from the `deployment/github_app` directory.
  This will pull the latest version of the IAMbic Docker image and update your Lambda function to use it.

2. The `plan` and `apply` process are performed via merge workflow. main branch is first checked out and then merge the changes requested in the PR. This is to ensure the plan is as up-to-date as possible. At any time if there is conflict, the requester should pull origin/main into the PR branch and allow iambic github action to replan the changes.

3. Do I need a dedicated GitHub account to run IAMbic?

	A: #TODO

4. Can I use my existing GitHub repos to run IAMbic?

	A: #TODO

5. Can I set IAMbic to run on just a small portion of my cloud? How do I do that?

	A: #TODO

6. How do I debug the GitHub App?

	A: #TODO

7. How do I update the GitHub App Lambda?
