title: AWS
---

In this tutorial, you will configure IAMbic to manage IAM for an AWS account or multiple accounts in an AWS organization.
You will then practice using IAMbic to to create, manipulate, and expire a test group. These are the steps you will complete:

#### Setup
1. Configure IAMbic for AWS
2. Import AWS resources

#### Practice with an IAM role
3. Create and Manage an IAM role across multiple AWS accounts
4. Create dynamic permissions for your IAM role, which can vary depending on account
5. Create temporary permissions for your IAM role (IAMbic will automatically expire these)
6. Create temporary access rules for your IAM role (Requires Noq Enterprise)

#### Practice with Permission Sets and Managed Policies
7. Create and Manage an AWS Identity Center (SSO) Permission Set
8. Create dynamic permissions for your Permission Set, which can vary depending on account
9. Create temporary permissions for your Permission Set (IAMbic will automatically expire these)
10. Provide temporary (break-glass) access to your AWS Identity Center Permission Sets
11. Create and Manage an IAM Managed Policy


## Prerequisites

* A local Git repository to store your IAMbic templates (See [Getting Started](/getting_started/index.html) for guidance on setting this up)

* Administrative-level access to AWS in order to create and manage IAM identities. This level of access is required to create an IAM identity for the use of IAMbic and also to manage policies associated with it.

* These credentials should be configured in the terminal you are using to configure IAMbic.

* You should also be aware of [how AWS credentials are sourced locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/standardized-credentials.html#credentialProviderChain) by the Amazon SDKs. This will help debug different scenarios, such as credential prioritization and expiration.


## Setup

### 1. Configure IAMbic for AWS

Configure IAMbic by creating a local git repository and running `iambic setup`. You'll need to set up
an AWS Organization (Which will load all accounts for that organization into your Iambic configuration file),
or the AWS accounts that you wish to manage. For more specific guidance on `iambic setup`, please read our [Install and Configure](/getting_started/install_and_configure) guide.

If you'd prefer to manually write a configuration, please follow the guidance
[here](/how_to_guides/manually_create_the_configuration).

After configuring IAMbic, you should see your accounts referenced in your repository under `iambic_config.yaml`.
Feel free to move this file around in the repository. When IAMbic is run, it will look for the configuration
by referencing the `template_type` and it expects to find a template_type of `NOQ::Core::Config`.

### 2. Import AWS Resources

After configuring IAMbic for AWS, run the `iambic import` command from the repository you created.
This will read your configuiration, attempt to determine all AWS accounts in your environment,
and attempt to import IAM resources from each account.
In a production environment, automation provided by IAMbic will ensure that Git is continuously
updated with the cloud resources in your production environment. This allows you to monitor the
history of these groups via Git History.

IAMbic will attempt to logically group similar resources into the same template. For example, a
common pattern in naming cookie_cutter IAM roles (such as your `engineering` role) would be to
prefix the role with the account name that the role resides on. If you had an engineering role
 on accounts named `prod`, `test`, and `staging` respectively, the engineering role might be
 named `prod_engineering`, `test_engineering`, and `staging_engineering`. This
naming convention makes it easier to identify the correct role when looking at Cloudtrail logs
without having to look up the account ID from the ARN. IAMbic will intelligently group these
roles in the same template. IAMbic will correctly account for different permissions and
access rules based on the account.

Run the following command to import resources from your AWS account(s):

```bash
iambic import
```

Once the import has successfully finished, your repository should have a folder structure, with YAML templates nested under each directory structure. It should resemble the following:

```bash
$ tree -L 4
├── config
│   └── config.yaml
└── resources
    └── aws
        ├── identity_center
        │   └── permission_sets
        ├── managed_policies
        │   └── account_1
        └── roles
            ├── all_accounts
            ├── multi_account
            ├── account_1
            ├── account_2
            └── account_3
```

You've completed the setup configuration connecting your AWS Organization or accounts to IAMBic. Now you will practice using IAMbic to execute basic IAM management skills.

## 3 Create and Manage an IAM role across multiple AWS accounts

 Now you will create an AWS role across all of the AWS accounts that you've configured. In future steps, we will modify this role to demonstrate some of IAMbic's features. If you've only configured one account, you may still follow this tutorial. It just won't be as exciting :).

A sample multi-account role template is below. It will propagate a role across all known accounts, including new accounts as they are discovered.

Grab your favorite code editor, have your Git repo handy, and let's get to work. First, you'll create a directory for your template if it doesn't already exist. Then you'll edit an appropriately named YAML file for your template.

```bash
# Create a directory in your iambic-templates repo
mkdir -p resources/aws/roles/

# Open the config.yaml file with your favorite editor, and save the template you crafted above
code resources/aws/roles/iambic_test_role.yaml
```

Next, we'll create a multi-account role template. An example template is below; it can be used as-is, or modified. Take the contents of this template and write it to the iambic_test_role.yaml file we're editing.

:::danger

If there are other roles with the role name specified in the template below, they will be overwritten. We've chosen a role name that is specific to IAMbic, so we hope there won't be any conflict.

:::

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
identifier: "{{account_name}}_iambic_test_role"
included_accounts:
  - "*"
properties:
  description: IAMbic test role on {{account_name}}
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action: sts:AssumeRole
        effect: Deny
        principal:
          service: ec2.amazonaws.com
  inline_policies:
    - policy_name: spoke-acct-policy
      statement:
        - action:
            - sqs:GetQueueAttributes
          effect: Deny
          resource: "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:{{account_id}}:fakequeue"
  managed_policies:
    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess
  path: /iambic_test/
  permissions_boundary:
    policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDirectConnectReadOnlyAccess
  role_name: "{{account_name}}_iambic_test_role"
```
<!-- #TODO why are we using the word template here? Have we ever defined template for users? -->
Save the template, and in your terminal, use IAMbic to apply the change.

```bash
iambic apply -t resources/aws/roles/all_accounts/iambic_test_role.yaml
```

If all went according to plan, you should now have a new role across all of the accounts you've defined, or the accounts we've detected in AWS Organizations.
<!-- #TODO what if all did not go according to plan?? -->

### 3.1 - Create dynamic IAM role policies that vary per account

Now that we've created an IAM role, let's vary some of the policies based on the accounts at our disposal.

Let's add a new inline policy on only a couple of our accounts. You'll need to replace the `ACCOUNT_A` and `ACCOUNT_B` placeholders below with the names or account IDs of some of your accounts.

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
identifier: "{{account_name}}_iambic_test_role"
included_accounts:
  - "*"
properties:
  description: IAMbic test role on {{account_name}}
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action: sts:AssumeRole
        effect: Deny
        principal:
          service: ec2.amazonaws.com
  inline_policies:
    - policy_name: spoke-acct-policy
      statement:
        - excluded_accounts: # Include the policy on the role across all accounts, except ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_A
          action:
            - s3:ListBucket
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
        - included_accounts: # Only include the policy statement on ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_A
          action:
            - s3:GetObject
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
        - included_accounts: # Include the policy statement on all accounts except ACCOUNT_A and ACCOUNT_B
            - "*"
          excluded_accounts:
            - ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_B
          action:
            - s3:ListAllMyBuckets
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
  managed_policies:
    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess
  path: /iambic_test/
  permissions_boundary:
    policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDirectConnectReadOnlyAccess
  role_name: "{{account_name}}_iambic_test_role"
```

Save the template, and in your terminal, use IAMbic to apply the change.

```bash
iambic apply -t resources/aws/roles/all_accounts/iambic_test_role.yaml
```

### 3.2 - Create Temporary, Expiring IAM Permissions

Now it's time to learn the process of writing temporary permissions that expire after a set period of time. Permissions are only expired if you're running IAMbic continually (IAMbic includes GitHub actions to automate this). For the purposes of this tutorial, we will trigger a run locally. In the template below, you'll notice the addition of the `expires_at:` attribute on different lines. Add them to your file.
<!-- #TODO There's not a lot of actual instruction here, we're just showing an edited file. Could maybe use one more sentence. -->

Notice that `expires_at` can be a datetime string, a date, or even "tomorrow", "yesterday", "in N days", etc. This is thanks to the wonderful [dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/) library ❤️.

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
identifier: "{{account_name}}_iambic_test_role"
included_accounts:
  - "*"
expires_at: in 3 days
properties:
  description: IAMbic test role on {{account_name}}
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action: sts:AssumeRole
        effect: Deny
        principal:
          service: ec2.amazonaws.com
  inline_policies:
    - policy_name: spoke-acct-policy
      statement:
        - expires_at: 2021-01-01
          excluded_accounts: # Include the policy on the role across all accounts, except ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_A
          action:
            - s3:ListBucket
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
        - expires_at: tomorrow
          included_accounts: # Only include the policy statement on ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_A
          action:
            - s3:GetObject
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
        - expires_at: in 4 hours
          included_accounts: # Include the policy statement on all accounts except ACCOUNT_A and ACCOUNT_B
            - "*"
          excluded_accounts:
            - ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_B
          action:
            - s3:ListAllMyBuckets
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
  managed_policies:
    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess
  path: /iambic_test/
  permissions_boundary:
    policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDirectConnectReadOnlyAccess
  role_name: "{{account_name}}_iambic_test_role"
```

Now run the apply command.

```bash
iambic apply -t resources/aws/roles/all_accounts/iambic_test_role.yaml
```

Once it has run, you'll notice the changes reflected in the cloud immediately, and the file has been updated to reflect the changes.
<!-- #TODO updated how? With a specific time stamp?  -->

### 3.3 Create temporary access rules ![Enterprise Feature](/img/mark.svg)

<!-- #TODO Nothing about this pertains to temporary access. -->
Noq Enterprise is capable of brokering temporary AWS IAM role credentials for end-users and applications. Noq integrates tightly with your single-sign-on provider of choice (almost anything that speaks SAML or OpenID Connect), tightly integrating to provide credentials to your existing groups and users. These credentials can be IP-restricted (either to a static list of IP addresses, such as a list of VPN NAT addresses, or to the requester's IP address). Lastly, the Noq-CLI utility provides a number of developer-friendly methods for managing temporary IAM credentials.
<!-- #TODO Nothing about this pertains to temporary access. -->

To provide temporary access for a user, add an `access_rules` section to your YAML. <!-- #TODO where, exactly? Does it matter? --> The following is an example access rules stanza that provides access to the user `user@example.com`, and group `group_name`. The access rules are applied to the role across all accounts, unless `included_accounts` or `excluded_accounts` are specified.

```yaml
access_rules:
  - users:
      - user@example.com
  - groups:
      - group_name
```

We can further limit these access rules to the role across specific accounts:

```yaml
access_rules:
  - users:
      - user@example.com
    included_accounts:
      - ACCOUNT_A
  - groups:
      - group_name
    included_accounts:
      - ACCOUNT_A
```

In order to provide temporary access to a role (for breakglass use cases or otherwise), we will add an `expires_at` flag to the access rules. This will cause the access rules to expire after the specified time. The following example will expire the access rules in 3 days.

```yaml
access_rules:
  - users:
      - user@example.com
    expires_at: in 3 days
```

The template below provides a complete example of a role with temporary access rules.
<!-- #TODO In this version there's expires flags on both the whole file and some specific rules. We should be clear which we're talking about. -->
```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
identifier: "{{account_name}}_iambic_test_role"
included_accounts:
  - "*"
expires_at: in 3 days
access_rules:
  - users:
      - user@example.com
    expires_at: in 3 days
    included_accounts:
      - ACCOUNT_A
properties:
  description: IAMbic test role on {{account_name}}
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action: sts:AssumeRole
        effect: Deny
        principal:
          service: ec2.amazonaws.com
  inline_policies:
    - policy_name: spoke-acct-policy
      statement:
        - expires_at: 2021-01-01
          excluded_accounts: # Include the policy on the role across all accounts, except ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_A
          action:
            - s3:ListBucket
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
        - expires_at: tomorrow
          included_accounts: # Only include the policy statement on ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_A
          action:
            - s3:GetObject
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
        - expires_at: in 4 hours
          included_accounts: # Include the policy statement on all accounts except ACCOUNT_A and ACCOUNT_B
            - "*"
          excluded_accounts:
            - ACCOUNT_A
            - ACCOUNT_B
          action:
            - "*"
          effect: Deny
          resource: "*"
  managed_policies:
    - included_accounts:
        - ACCOUNT_A
      policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess
  path: /iambic_test/
  permissions_boundary:
    policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDirectConnectReadOnlyAccess
  role_name: "{{account_name}}_iambic_test_role"
```

Save the template, and in your terminal, use IAMbic to apply the change.

```bash
iambic apply -t resources/aws/roles/all_accounts/iambic_test_role.yaml
```

After applying the changes, the users specified in the access rules will now have access to the role in the Noq platform for 3 days.

### 4. AWS Identity Center Permission Sets  <!-- #TODO AKA Create dynamic permissions for your IAM role, which can vary depending on account -->

<!-- #TODO needs a sentence or 3 on what we're doing here, etc. Looks like this seciton isn't quite ready. -->

```bash
# Create a directory in your iambic-templates repo
mkdir -p resources/aws/identity_center/permission_sets/

# Open the yaml file with your favorite editor, and save the template you crafted above
code resources/aws/identity_center/permission_sets/iambic_test_permission_set.yaml
```
<!-- #TODO the instructions above don't quite make sense. Are we duplicating the file or ?? -->

#### 4.1 - Create a Permission Set

Just like IAM roles, IAMbic can be used to manage permission sets within AWS SSO (Identity Center). Here is an example of a permission set template:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IdentityCenter::PermissionSet
identifier: iambic_test_permission_set
included_orgs:
  - o-12345678
properties:
  name: iambic_test_permission_set
  description: Permission set for testing IAMbic
  inline_policy:
    statement:
      - action:
          - "*"
        effect: Deny
        resource:
          - "*"
  managed_policies:
    - arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess
  permissions_boundary:
    managed_policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDirectConnectReadOnlyAccess
  session_duration: PT1H
```

Apply the file by running `iambic apply`.
```bash
iambic apply -t resources/aws/identity_center/permission_sets/iambic_test_permission_set.yaml
```

#### 4.2 Provide temporary access to a permission set

To grant temporary access to a permission set, you can add an `access_rules` section to the YAML template.

This section specifies which users and groups can access the permission set, on which accounts they have access to, and for how long the access is valid. If the `included_accounts` field is not specified, the access rule will apply to all accounts configured in AWS Identity Center.

The example provided shows an access
rule that grants access to members of group `GROUP_1` on all accounts that start with
`ACCOUNT_` except for the `SENSITIVE_ACCOUNT` account.

```yaml
access_rules:
  - groups:
      - GROUP_1
    included_accounts:
      - ACCOUNT_*
    excluded_accounts:
      - SENSITIVE_ACCOUNT
    included_orgs:
      - o-12345678
```

The following is an example of the entire permission set template. Revise the users, groups, and
account references to match your environment:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IdentityCenter::PermissionSet
identifier: iambic_test_permission_set
included_orgs:
  - o-12345678
access_rules:
  - groups:
      - GROUP_1
    included_accounts:
      - ACCOUNT_*
    excluded_accounts:
      - SENSITIVE_ACCOUNT
    included_orgs:
      - o-12345678
properties:
  name: iambic_test_permission_set
  description: Permission set for testing IAMbic
  inline_policy:
    statement:
      - action:
          - "*"
        effect: Deny
        resource:
          - "*"
  managed_policies:
    - arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess
  permissions_boundary:
    managed_policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDirectConnectReadOnlyAccess
  session_duration: PT1H
```

#### 4.3 - Provide Temporary Access to an AWS Identity Center Permission Set

Similarly to IAM roles, access to IAM Permission Sets can be granted temporarily. This is
useful for situations where users need temporary elevated privileges (breakglass access).

```yaml
access_rules:
  - groups:
      - GROUP_1
    expires_at: tomorrow
    included_accounts:
      - ACCOUNT_1
    included_orgs:
      - o-12345678
```


#### 4.4 Attach temporary permissions to a permission set

AWS Identity Center can be used to broker temporary AWS IAM credentials to human users. IAMbic supports <!-- #TODO finish this sentence -->
