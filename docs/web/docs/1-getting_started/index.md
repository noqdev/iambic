## Getting Started

The pages in this section will guide you through setting up and configuring IAMbic, followed by your desired providers.

You can install iambic on your system with this command: `curl https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/install.sh | sh`

Alternatively, start with the [Installation](/getting_started/install_and_configure) page to get IAMbic up and running. Then install a provider
of your choice:

* [AWS](/getting_started/aws)
* [Okta](/getting_started/okta)
* [Google](/getting_started/google)

After you've gone through the tutorials, follow the [Github](/getting_started/github) deployment instructions to deploy IAMbic for continuous import (This keeps your IAMbic templates up to date with changes detected in your cloud providers) and to set up your CI/CD pipeline for approval workflows.
