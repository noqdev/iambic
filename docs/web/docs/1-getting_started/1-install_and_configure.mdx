### Set up a Git repository

You'll need to create a dedicated Git repository. If you're just trying out IAMbic, create a [local Git repository](/technical_reference/installation/local_git_repo).
When you're ready to deploy IAMbic, create a [Github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).
GitHub is preferable because Noq provides [Github workflows](/getting_started/github) that keep IAM entitlements updated within your repository.

Now you are ready to use IAMbic - follow the instructions in the next step "Using IAMbic".

### Using IAMbic

#### Configure IAM credentials

Configure AWS credentials before running IAMbic. You can accomplish this by either setting environment variables with your credentials, setting an AWS_PROFILE, or another supported method.
Please reference the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) for more details.

#### One Liner Installation script

If you want to use our install script to install iambic, you can use this command: `curl https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/install.sh | ${SHELL}`.

If you are getting an error with the curl command, you may find that this command: `curl https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/install.sh | bash` might be more reliable.

Note: this automatically creates the IAMbic templates git repository on your system under `~/iambic_templates`, if you'd like to setup IAMbic's 
template git repo elsewhere, use the `IAMBIC_GIT_REPO_PATH` env var when calling our install script:

```bash
export IAMBIC_GIT_REPO_PATH="~/path/to/your/templates/repo" # this directory will get created and initialized if it does not yet exist.
curl https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/install.sh | ${SHELL}
```

#### Docker

The easiest way to get started with IAMbic is through Docker and alias `iambic` to the docker command. This will allow you to run IAMbic from anywhere on your system.

Follow these instructions to set up the Alias depending on your shell. Be sure to replace `$AWS_PROFILE` with the name of the AWS profile you want to use.

Bash:

```bash
echo -e "\nalias iambic='docker run \
  -it \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v ${HOME}/.aws:/app/.aws \
  -e AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/app/.aws/config \
  -e AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/app/.aws/credentials \
  -e "AWS_PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE}" \
  -v .:/templates:Z \
  public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest \"\$@\"'\n" >> ~/.bashrc

. ~/.bashrc
```

ZSH:

```zsh
echo -e "\nalias iambic='docker run \
  -it \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v ${HOME}/.aws:/app/.aws \
  -e AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/app/.aws/config \
  -e AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/app/.aws/credentials \
  -e "AWS_PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE}" \
  -v .:/templates:Z \
  public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest \"\$@\"'\n" >> ~/.zshrc

. ~/.zshrc
```

Please reference the [IAMbic and Docker](/technical_reference/installation/install_via_docker) section for more details on using the IAMbic Docker container.

You can also [install the wheel](/technical_reference/installation/install_via_the_wheel), or [install IAMbic locally](/technical_reference/installation/download_the_repo).

Test whether you can run IAMbic: `iambic --help`

### Configuring IAMbic

Run `iambic setup` command to launch the [Configuration Wizard](/how_to_guides/configure_iambic_with_wizard). Alternatively, you can [create the configuration by hand](/how_to_guides/manually_create_the_configuration).


### Next Steps

Now that you have IAMbic installed and configured, you're ready to move on to the next steps. At this point, your experience will vary depending on the goals you want to achieve:

- [Continue with AWS](./aws)
- [Continue with Okta](./okta)
- [Continue with Google](./google)
