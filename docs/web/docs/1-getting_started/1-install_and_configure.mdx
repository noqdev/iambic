### Set up a Git repository

You'll need to create a dedicated Git repository. If you're just trying out IAMbic, create a [local Git repository](/technical_reference/installation/local_git_repo).
When you're ready to deploy IAMbic, create a [GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).
GitHub is preferable because Noq provides [GitHub workflows](/getting_started/github) that keep IAM entitlements updated within your repository.

Now you are ready to use IAMbic.
```bash
mkdir iambic-templates
cd iambic-templates
git init
cat <<EOF > .gitignore
**/secrets.yaml
proposed_changes.yaml
EOF
```

### Using IAMbic

Firs you'll need to configure the AWS credentials, then you can select your preferred method of installation: shell script or Docker,

#### Configure IAM credentials

Configure AWS credentials before running IAMbic. You can accomplish this by either setting environment variables with your credentials, setting an AWS_PROFILE, or another supported method.
Please reference the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) for more details.

#### Install IAMbic

If you want to use our install script to install iambic, you can use this command:

* [Create a git repo](./install_and_configure#set-up-a-git-repository)
* [Setup your AWS profile](./install_and_configure#configure-iam-credentials)
* Download and install iambic:
```bash
curl https://iambic.org/scripts/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Note: we require sudo because we are installing the script `iambic` into `/usr/local/bin/` of your file system to ensure it is in your path.

For detailed Docker setup instructions, please visit the [Install via Docker](/technical_reference/installation/install_via_docker) guide.

You can also [install the wheel](/technical_reference/installation/install_via_the_wheel), or [install IAMbic locally](/technical_reference/installation/download_the_repo). <!-- #TODO why would I want these options? We need one liner each about what benefit they offer or about what circumstance might make me choose them. -->

### Configuring IAMbic

We recommend using an AWS IAM identity (user or role) with administrative privileges
to use the Iambic Setup Wizard. Alternatively, you'll need the permissions specified [here](/technical_reference/aws_permissions_for_setup_wizard)
in order to proceed..

Run `iambic setup` command to launch the [Configuration Wizard](/how_to_guides/configure_iambic_with_wizard).

Alternatively, you can [create the configuration by hand](/how_to_guides/manually_create_the_configuration).


### Next Steps

Now that you have IAMbic installed and configured, you're ready to move on to the next steps. At this point, your experience will vary depending on the goals you want to achieve. You may configure any number of these identitiy providers to work with IAMbic.
