The pages in this section will guide you through setting up and configuring IAMbic, followed by your desired identity providers.

Please begin with the following pages:

1. [Prerequisites](/getting_started/prerequisites)
2. [Installation and Configuration](/getting_started/install_and_configure)
3. Configure a provider of your choice:

* [AWS](/getting_started/aws)
* [Azure AD](/getting_started/azure_ad)
* [Okta](/getting_started/okta)
* [Google Workspace](/getting_started/google)

Once you've completed the tutorials, proceed to the [GitHub](/getting_started/install_and_configure#setup-github-application) deployment guide.
This guide will help you set up a GitHub Application, Lambda function, and AWS EventBridge rules to handle
periodic cloud resource imports, expiration of identities, permissions, and access rules, as well as
establish a GitOps approval flow process.
