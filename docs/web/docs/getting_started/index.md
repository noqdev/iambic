# Getting Started

## Set up your local environment

This section of the tutorial poses the greatest risk of complications as it pertains to the setup of IAMbic. If you encounter any issues, do not hesitate to reach out for assistance in our [Slack Community](https://communityinviter.com/apps/noqcommunity/noq). Our team would be delighted to assist you.

### Before You Start

You will need to have the following configured, and know the basics of using them, before proceeding:

- Git (see [GitHub’s set up Git guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git))
- Ability to create a GitHub Repository
- One or more of the following: (TODO: Guidance needed for each of these flows)
  - AWS Credentials
  - Okta Credentials
  - Google Credentials

#### Install Docker and Docker Compose

- Install Docker (see [Docker&#39;s Quick Start Guide)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/get-started/)

Confirm Docker is installed properly with the following command:
`docker run --rm busybox true`

#### Install Python (for local development)

If you're following the local development guide, you'll also need Python 3.10+ before proceeding:

- Install Python 3.10+ (see the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

Confirm Python is installed properly with the following command:
`python -c "print('It\'s working!')"`

### Docker

We recommend using Docker to run IAMbic, as this provides the most accurate representation of its intended operation and helps to prevent issues caused by variations between different systems. If you plan to make changes to IAMbic, we suggest installing IAMbic locally instead. Guidance can be found in our Local Development guide below.

### Local Development

TBD

### Create a local Git Repository

IAMbic can use any folder as a database-on-disk. We strongly suggest using a version control system, as this will allow IAMbic to keep a historical record of changes to your Cloud IAM over time.  We have created GitHub action workflows to automate the IAMbic processes as much as possible. For the purposes of the tutorials in IAMbic, we will use a Git repository that only exists on your system. If you wish to configure Iambic in production, we recommend configuring a repository in GitHub as Iambic ships with GitHub actions that keep your repo in-sync with your cloud environment. (#TODO: Link to a production setup flow and reference this doc: Guidance on how to create a repository can be found in [Github&#39;s guide for creating a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).)

Create a private GitHub repository called `iambic-templates`.

```bash
mkdir iambic-templates
cd iambic-templates
git init
```

## Onto the Next Steps

Now that you have IAMbic installed, you're ready to move on to the next steps. At this point, your experience will vary depending on the goals you want to achieve:

- Continue with AWS
- Continue with Okta
- Continue with Google
