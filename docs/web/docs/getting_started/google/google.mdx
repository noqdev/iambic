Noq's SaaS Platform provides enterprise Self-Service features that make Google Group requests easier for end-users. Reach out to us at [hello@noq.dev](mailto:hello@noq.dev) or visit [https://www.noq.dev](https://www.noq.dev) for more information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

* A local Git repository to store your IAMbic templates (See [Getting Started](/getting_started/index.html) for guidance on setting this up)
* A Google Workspace account, and administrative access to it
* Set the following environment variables in the terminal you will be using to run Iambic commands.
  These are only needed for the duration of this tutorial. They are not required for the normal usage of Iambic:

```bash
export DOMAIN=<your_gsuite_domain.com>
export EMAIL=<your_gsuite_email_address>
```

## Configure Iambic for Google Group Management

In this section, you will set up a Google Cloud Identity that will be used by Iambic to manage your Google Groups.
Perform the following steps to set up your identity:

1. Sign in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project for Iambic
3. Enable the [Admin SDK](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=admin.googleapis.com)
  and the [Cloud Identity API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudidentity.googleapis.com)
4. Create a service account for Iambic with access to the Admin SDK API, and access to User Data.

5. Enable Domain Wide Delegation for the Google account with the following scopes: (TODO: Needs censoring)
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.security
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member

6. Follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/how-to/setup) to assign an admin role to your service account

7. Download the JSON key file for your service account

8. Create an Iambic configuration file for your Google Workspace account. This configuration file will instruct Iambic to load a
   secrets.yaml file that will be created in the next step, and to enable google groups management.
   Run the following command from the root of your `iambic-templates` repository to generate the configuration file:

```bash
# Run from the root folder of your iambic-templates repository
mkdir -p config
cat <<EOF > config/config.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Core::Config
version: "1"
extends:
  - key: LOCAL_FILE
    value: secrets.yaml
google:
  groups:
    enabled: true
EOF
```

Create a `secrets.yaml` in your `config` directory with your service accounts secrets.
An example is provided below, but you will need to replace the values with your own.
These secrets can be found in the JSON key file you downloaded in the previous step.

:::danger

Never commit secrets Git. Ensure that you have a  `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your `iambic-templates` repository that
is configured to ignore secrets.yaml files with `**/secrets.yaml`. Learn more about `.gitignore` files [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

:::

```yaml
secrets:
  google:
    - subjects:
      - domain: "iambic.org"
        service_account: "iambic-...@iambic-....iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      type: "service_account"
      project_id: "iambic-..."
      private_key_id: "bfa86..."
      private_key: "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEv...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
      client_email: "iambic-...@iambic-....iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      client_id: "1165324...."
      auth_uri: "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
      token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
      auth_provider_x509_cert_url: "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
      client_x509_cert_url: "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/iambic..."
```

From the base directory of your IAMbic templates repository, your directory structure should resemble the following. You may
have more files if you've recently imported your cloud resources.

```bash
tree .
.
├── config
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── secrets.yaml
```

## Import Existing Google Groups

In this section, you will manually import existing Google Groups into your IAMbic templates repository.
In a production environment, automation provided by Iambic would ensure that Git is updated with the
cloud resources in your production environment. This allows you to monitor the history of
these groups via Git History.

Run the following command in the root of your `iambic-templates` repository to import your existing Google Groups:

```bash
iambic import
```

If you have Google Groups defined, your iambic-templates repository should have a `google/groups` directory with a
subdirectory for each domain you have defined.

## Create a Google group

Iambic uses a YAML file to describe the desired state of a Google Group. In this section, we will create a group called
`iambic-test-group` in your domain. Ensure that the environment variables you've set previously are still configured,
and also ensure that your credentials are working properly by running the import process from the previous section.

Run the following set of commands from the root of your `iambic-templates` repository to create a new Google Group template:

```bash
mkdir -p google/groups/$DOMAIN
cat <<EOF > google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Google::Group
properties:
  name: iambic-test-group
  description: ''
  domain: $DOMAIN
  email: iambic-test-group@$DOMAIN
  members:
    - email: $EMAIL
      role: OWNER
EOF
```

Apply the template to your Google Workspace account by running the following command:

:::info

In a production environment, this would be handled by a command issued on a Github Pull Request after the appropriate approvals have been made.

:::

```bash
iambic apply -t google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
```

Confirm that the group has been created by running the following in your terminal, and visiting the URL in your browser:

```bash
echo https://groups.google.com/a/$DOMAIN/g/iambic-test-group
```

:::tip

You can add Subgroups to the google group with the  `type: GROUP` property. Here's an example:

```yaml
  - email: testgroup@DOMAIN.com
    type: GROUP
```

:::

By now the directory of your `iambic-templates` repository should resemble the following,
and may include other resources that you've imported:

```bash
$ tree .
.
├── config
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── secrets.yaml
├── google
│   └── groups
│       └── $DOMAIN
│           ├── iambic-test-group.yaml
```

## Add a user to the group

In this section, we will add a user (testuser@example.com) to the group we created in the previous section.
`example.com` is a reserved domain for this use case, and `testuser@example.com` is not a real user.

Run the following command to replace the previous group you created with a new one that includes the new user:

```bash
cat <<EOF > google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Google::Group
properties:
  name: iambic-test-group
  description: ''
  domain: $DOMAIN
  email: iambic-test-group@$DOMAIN
  members:
    - email: $EMAIL
      role: OWNER
    - email: fakeuser@example.com
EOF
```

Run the `apply` command again to update the group:

```bash
iambic apply -t google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
```

## Provide temporary ("break-glass") access to a Google Group

In this section, we will provide `fakeuser@example.com` with break-glass access to the `iambic-test-group` we created in the
previous section. Our fakeuser only needs access for two minutes (This user works very quickly). In order to facilitate this request,
we will add an expiration date to the user's membership in the group. Run the following command to replace the previous group you
created with a new one that includes the additional user and an expiration date:

:::tip

If a specific expiration date is provided without a timezone, Iambic will assume the timezone is UTC.
If a timezone is provided, Iambic will use that timezone.

:::

```bash
cat <<EOF > google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Google::Group
expires_at: tomorrow
properties:
  name: iambic-test-group
  description: ''
  domain: $DOMAIN
  email: iambic-test-group@$DOMAIN
  members:
    - email: $EMAIL
      role: OWNER
    - email: fakeuser@example.com
      expires_at: in 2 minutes
EOF
```

```bash
iambic apply -t google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
```

After applying the change, notice that the `expires_at` date in the template was converted from a relative expiration time ("in two minutes")
to an absolute date (Example: "2021-05-20T15:00:00-04:00"). This allows Iambic to know exactly when the request should be expired.

Confirm that the user was added by visiting the following URL in your browser:

```bash
echo https://groups.google.com/a/$DOMAIN/g/iambic-test-group
```

After a couple of minutes, the request should expire. In a production deployment, this process would be automatic. But for the purposes
of testing, you can manually expire the request by re-running the apply command:

```bash
iambic apply -t google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
```

## Expire the Google Group

In this section, we will update the Google Group we created in the previous section so the group will expire in one minute. Notice the extra
line at the top-level of the YAML below, `expires_at: in one minute`.

Run the following command to update the group template.

```bash
cat <<EOF > google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
template_type: NOQ::Google::Group
expires_at: in one minute
properties:
  name: iambic-test-group
  description: ''
  domain: $DOMAIN
  email: iambic-test-group@$DOMAIN
  members:
    - email: $EMAIL
      role: OWNER
    - email: fakeuser@example.com
      expires_at: in 2 minutes
EOF

iambic apply -t google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml

cat google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
```

In the last line of the above command, we printed the contents of the template to the terminal.
Notice that the `expires_at` date has been updated from a relative time to an absolute date.
This allows Iambic to know exactly when the request should be expired.

After a minute, re-run the apply command to expire the request.

```bash
iambic apply -t google/groups/$DOMAIN/iambic-test-group.yaml
```
