## 1. Configure Okta

In this tutorial, you will configure IAMbic for an Okta Organization. By the end of this tutorial,
you will have performed the following steps:

1. Create a basic Okta configuration for Iambic
2. Create an Okta Group with users


## Prerequisities

You will need administrative access to an existing Okta organization. If you do not have one, you can
create a developer organization at [developer.okta.com](https://developer.okta.com/).

## 1.1 Create a basic Okta configuration for Iambic

First, you'll need to create an API token that allows Okta to manage group memberships by
signing in to Okta and following these steps:

1. Click on Security
2. Click on API
3. Click on Tokens
4. Click on "Create Token"
5. Create a token for Iambic. This token will be used to authenticate Iambic with Okta.
6. Copy the value of the token.

With your token in hand, create the following file
in your iambic repo:


```yaml
secrets:
  okta:
    - idp_name: development
      org_url: https://dev-12345.okta.com/
      api_token: <TOKEN>
```


Security -> API -> Tokens -> Create Token



Store the token in the Iambic configuration file.
