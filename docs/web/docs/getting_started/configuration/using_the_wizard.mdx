## Wizard

The easiest way to get started with Iambic is to run the Wizard. The wizard will generate a configuration file that matches your environment by asking specific questions in an easy to follow Q&A style.

Start the wizard by first [installing either the `docker` container](../installation/install_via_docker), [installing the iambic wheel](../installation/install_via_the_wheel) into the virtual environment of your choice or [installing the IAMbic project from source](../installation/download_the_repo).

### Usage

Start by setting up your AWS profile that you would like to use with IAMbic. This profile should be associated with the account and/or organization that you would like to manage with IAMbic.

    export AWS_PROFILE=<profile name here\>

Once your configuration is setup, head on over to the **integrations** section to integrate IAMbic with the identity provider of your choice: [Integrations](../integrations)
