# Getting Started

This page will guide you through setting up the required technologies that will allow you to run IAMbic.

The preferred way to use IAMbic is to install it as a docker container. You can either

1. Download the image from our build servers
1. Build the image yourself

Please reference the [IAMbic and Docker](./installation_and_usage/docker.mdx) section for more details on using the IAMbic docker container.

## Setting up your local environment

This section of the tutorial has the greatest potential for complications, as it pertains to the setup of IAMbic. If you encounter any issues, do not hesitate to reach out for assistance in our [Slack Community](https://communityinviter.com/apps/noqcommunity/noq). Our team would be delighted to assist you.

### Before You Start

Before proceeding you will need to have the following configured, and know the basics of using them:

- Python 3.10+ (see [Python’s download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) <!-- #TODO is python required if we use the docker install below? -->
- Git (see [GitHub’s set up Git guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git))
- ability to create a GitHub Repository
- one or more of the following: <!-- #TODO: Guidance needed for each of these flows -->
  - AWS Credentials
  - Okta Credentials
  - Google Credentials

Once these requisites are complete, you can select from a Python or Docker based install, and configure Git.
<!-- #TODO: is that true? --><!-- #TODO those should link to the right sections -->

### Install Python

Use one of the following methods to install Python on your system:

Linux, using python (and docker??? #TODO) (links to sections below)

Mac, using python (and docker??? #TODO)
<!-- #TODO what is the alternataive to Docker?? -->

#### Linux

```bash
# Debian-based:
sudo apt install wget git python3 python3-venv
# Red Hat-based:
sudo dnf install wget git python3
# Arch-based:
sudo pacman -S wget git python3
```
<!-- #TODO put copy icons next to each code block. -->
#### Mac

Install from [Python's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or
via [Brew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install python@3.10
```
<!-- #TODO This says "also" but it's unclear what docker is an alternative to.
If I don't install docker, how do I install iambic? Need to update the above -->

### Install Docker and Docker Compose


You may also use Docker to run Iambic, as this provides the most accurate environment for its
intended operation and helps to prevent issues caused by variations between different systems.
If you plan to make changes to IAMbic, we suggest installing IAMbic locally instead.
Guidance can be found in our Local Development guide below.


- Install Docker (see [Docker's Quick Start Guide)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/get-started/)

- Confirm Docker is installed properly:
`docker run --rm busybox true`


### Create a local Git Repository

IAMbic can use any folder as a database-on-disk. We strongly suggest using a version control system, as this will allow IAMbic to keep a historical record of changes to your Cloud IAM over time. We have created GitHub action workflows to automate the IAMbic processes as much as possible. For the purposes of the tutorials in IAMbic, we will use a Git repository that only exists on your system. If you wish to configure IAMbic in production, we recommend configuring a repository in GitHub, as IAMbic ships with GitHub actions that keep your local repo in-sync with your cloud environment. (#TODO: Link to a production setup flow and reference this doc: Guidance on how to create a repository can be found in [Github&#39;s guide for creating a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).)

Create a private GitHub repository called `iambic-templates`.

```bash
mkdir iambic-templates
cd iambic-templates
git init
cat <<EOF > .gitignore
**/secrets.yaml
EOF
```

## Onto the Next Steps

Now that you have IAMbic installed, you're ready to move on to the next steps. At this point, your experience will vary depending on the goals you want to achieve:

- Continue with AWS
- Continue with Okta
- Continue with Google
