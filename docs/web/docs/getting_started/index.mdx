## Getting Started

This page will guide you through setting up the required technologies that will allow you to run IAMbic.

### First things first

You'll need to create a dedicated git repository. If you're just trying out IAMbic, you may choose just to create a local repository, which is absolutely fine. If you want to start collaborating with others on identity and access management via IAMbic, Noq recommends that you also create a [Github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo); you can also integrate IAMbic with your [Github workflows](./integrations/github).

To create a new bare repository, create a directory and initialize the git repository like so: `git init .` -- if you want to have more information about creating a local repository, here is [additional information](./installation/local_git_repo).

Now you are ready to use IAMbic - follow the instructions in the next step "Getting started with IAMbic".

### Using IAMbic

The preferred way to use IAMbic is to install it as a docker container. You can either

1. Download the image from our build servers
1. Build the image yourself

Please reference the [IAMbic and Docker](./installation/install_via_docker) section for more details on using the IAMbic docker container.

When running IAMbic for the first time, use the `iambic setup` command to launch the [Wizard](./configuration/using_the_wizard).

### Onto the Next Steps

Now that you have IAMbic installed, you're ready to move on to the next steps. At this point, your experience will vary depending on the goals you want to achieve:

- [Continue with AWS](./integrations/aws)
- [Continue with Okta](./integrations/okta)
- [Continue with Google](./integrations/google)
