title: Local Git Repository

IAMbic can use any folder as a database-on-disk. We strongly suggest using a version control system, as this will allow IAMbic to keep a historical record of changes to your Cloud IAM over time. We have created GitHub action workflows to automate the IAMbic processes as much as possible.


For the purposes of these IAMbic tutorials, we will use a Git repository that only exists on your system. To configure IAMbic in production, we recommend configuring a repository in GitHub, as IAMbic ships with GitHub actions that keep your local repo syncronized with your cloud environment.

(#TODO: Link to a production setup flow and reference this doc: Guidance on how to create a repository can be found in [Github&#39;s guide for creating a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).)

Create a private GitHub repository called `iambic-templates`.

```bash
mkdir iambic-templates
cd iambic-templates
git init
cat <<EOF > .gitignore
**/secrets.yaml
EOF
```
