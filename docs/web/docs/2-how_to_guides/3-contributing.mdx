title: Contribute to IAMbic
---

## Interested in contributing?

This guide assumes that you already have a local Git repository that contains your IAMbic templates.
If you have not yet set this up, head on over to [setup the local git repository](/technical_reference/installation/local_git_repo) first.

### Setting up your local environment

This section of the tutorial has the greatest potential for complications, as it pertains to the setup of IAMbic.
If you encounter any issues, do not hesitate to reach out for assistance in our [Slack Community](https://communityinviter.com/apps/noqcommunity/noq).
Our team would be delighted to assist you.

## Before You Start

Before proceeding you will need to have the following configured, and know the basics of using them:

- Python 3.10+ (see [Python’s download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) <!-- #TODO is python required if we use the docker install below? -->
- Git (see [GitHub’s set up Git guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git))
- GitHub
- One or more of the following configured:
  - [AWS Credentials](/getting_started/aws)
  - [Okta Credentials](/getting_started/okta)
  - [Google Credentials](/getting_started/google)

Once these requisites are complete, you can select from a Python or Docker based install, and configure Git.
<!-- #TODO: is that true? -->


<!-- #TODO Why are there install instructions on the contribution page? Contributing users probably alread have iambic installed, and if not, they shoudl be pointed at the main installation page, not duplicate the information here.  -->

### Install Python

Use one of the following methods to install Python on your system:

#### Linux

```bash
# Debian-based:
sudo apt install wget git python3 python3-venv
``

```bash
# Red Hat-based:
sudo dnf install wget git python3
```

```bash
# Arch-based:
sudo pacman -S wget git python3
```

#### Mac

Install from [Python's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or
via [Brew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install python@3.10
```

### Install Docker and Docker Compose


You may also use Docker to run IAMbic, as this provides the most accurate environment for its
intended operation and helps to prevent issues caused by variations between different systems.
If you plan to make changes to IAMbic, we suggest installing IAMbic locally instead.
Guidance can be found in our Local Development guide below.


- Install Docker (see [Docker's Quick Start Guide)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/get-started/)

- Confirm Docker is installed properly:
`docker run --rm busybox true`

### Install VSCode

We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your IDE for developing IAMbic. VSCode
ships with Run and Debug configurations that make it easier to get started with IAMbic development.

### Install and configure your Python environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
# Install IAMbic from your local IAMbic repository
pip install -e . # Alternatively, you can use poetry
```


### Install and configure pre-commit

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Create a `.env` file

IAMbic uses a `.env` file to store environment variables. When running VSCode run configurations, your .env file
can be used to define environment-specific run configuration for IAMbic.


```text
# Replace value the name of a valid profile from your ~/.aws/config or ~/.aws/credentials file
AWS_PROFILE=A_VALID_AWS_PROFILE
# Replace value with the name of a valid IAMBic template
IAMBIC_TEMPLATE_PATH=../iambic-templates/resources/aws/roles/specific_template.yaml

# Replace value with the location of your IAMbic templates directory
IAMBIC_REPO_DIR=../iambic-templates

# The following options are only required if you are testing IAMbic Lambda functionality locally
IAMBIC_FROM_SHA=1234dca837c0b3fa50d9d2aa926b386b1344501b
IAMBIC_TO_SHA=aa41e4dac35e4bf9eae22fe47d638fc134fd1f11
IAMBIC_LAMBDA_CONFIG="arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:iambic-secrets"
IAMBIC_LAMBDA_CONFIG_ASSUME_ROLE="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/IambicSpokeRole"
```

### Run IAMbic import through VSCode

Run `iambic import` through VSCode to ensure that IAMbic is installed and configured properly.

### Fork the repository and create a pull request

Visit https://github.com/noqdev/iambic and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.

Clone your fork locally, and add the upstream repository as a remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/noqdev/iambic.git
```

Make changes to your forked repository and commit the changes.

```bash
# Check out a new branch
git checkout -b my-new-feature
# Hack hack hack.. (Make changes)
# Commit change to a branch on your repository
git commit -am "Add some feature"
# Push your branch to your forked repository
git push origin my-new-feature
```

After pushing your changes to your branch, submit a Pull Request to IAMbic:

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button on the top right corner of the repository page.
3. Verify that the changes you made are selected for the pull request.
4. Write a descriptive message for the pull request explaining your changes.
5. Click the "Create pull request" button.
6. Wait for the team to review and merge your pull request.

That's it! You have successfully forked IAMbic in GitHub and submitted a pull request to the original repository.
