## Configuration File Reference

The configuration file is written in YAML and needs to be created before IAMbic can be used the first time.
It stores all the information about your environment and provides credentials to cloud services and GitHub.
We recommend that you use the [Setup Wizard](configure_iambic_with_wizard) to quickly start
creating your configuration file.

This document provides an overview of the YAML configuration for Noq's core configuration,
which has `template_type: NOQ::Core::Config`
.
This configuration is used to specify AWS accounts and organizations that IAMbic has access to,
via [Hub and Spoke roles](/technical_reference/aws_hub_and_spoke_roles).

The following is an example configuration for AWS Organizations:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::Core::Config
version: '1'

aws:
  organizations:
    - default_rule:
        iambic_managed: read_and_write
      hub_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/IambicHubRole
      identity_center:
        region: us-east-1
      org_account_id: '123456789012'
      org_id: o-yabc0a10zs
```

For information about the Iambic configuration model, please visit
[this link](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic/blob/main/iambic/config/dynamic_config.py#L96).

### template_type
The template_type field specifies the type of template, which is `NOQ::Core::Config`.

### extends
The extends field can be used to merge an additional configuration into the current configuration.
This is useful if you want to merge secrets from a separate configuration file into the current configuration,
or if you want to leverage AWS Secrets Manager to store secrets.

### version
The version field specifies the version number of the YAML configuration.

### aws
The aws field is used to specify AWS accounts and organizations that IAMbic has access to.
This field can contain two nested lists: `organizations` and/or `accounts`.

### aws.organizations
The organizations list is used to specify one or more organization entities within AWS.
 IAMbic can inspect organization entities to parse all attached accounts.

### aws.accounts
The accounts list is used to specify one or more AWS accounts that IAMbic should synchronize.
