## Configuration File Reference

The configuration file is written in YAML and needs to be created before IAMbic can be used the first time.
It stores all the information about your environment and provides credentials to cloud services and Github.
You can use the Wizard to quickly start creating your configuration file.

This document provides an overview of the YAML configuration for NOQ::Core::Config.
This configuration is used to specify AWS accounts and organizations that IAMbic has access to,
via [Hub and Spoke roles](/technical_reference/aws_hub_and_spoke_roles).


The following is an example configuration for AWS Organizations:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::Core::Config
version: '1'

aws:
  organizations:
    - default_rule:
        iambic_managed: read_and_write
      hub_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/IambicHubRole
      identity_center:
        region: us-east-1
      org_account_id: '123456789012'
      org_id: o-yabc0a10zs
```

### Template Type
The template_type field specifies the type of template, which is NOQ::Core::Config.

### Extends
The extends field describes the parent class or template that NOQ::Core::Config extends.

### Version
The version field specifies the version number of the YAML configuration.

### AWS
The aws field is used to specify AWS accounts and organizations that IAMbic has access to. This field contains two nested lists: organizations and accounts.

### Organizations
The organizations list is used to specify one or more organization entities within AWS. IAMbic can inspect organization entities to parse all attached accounts.

### Accounts
The accounts list is used to specify one or more AWS accounts that IAMbic should synchronize.

For more information about hub and spoke roles, see the [Hub and Spoke roles](/technical_reference/aws_hub_and_spoke_roles) documentation.
