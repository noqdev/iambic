## Copy resource to Rename

To rename a resource, the recommended approach is to duplicate (copy) the resource file you'd like to rename, update the name of the new resource with its new name, update the `identifier` attribute, and then set the `deleted: true` on the original resource template. See [How to delete a resource](/how_to_guides/how-do-i-delete-a-resource).

For instance if you have a demo-1 role that is defined in the `demo-1.yaml` file and you'd like to rename the demo-1 role to `demo-1-renamed`, you would first copy the demo-1.yaml file:

`cp demo-1.yaml demo-1-renamed.yaml`, change the `identifier` and `role_name` attributes in the demo-1-renamed.yaml file to reflect the new name.

In the demo-1.yaml file you should add the `deleted: true` attribute underneath the `template_type` attribute, see [How to delete a resource](/how_to_guides/how-do-i-delete-a-resource).

Lastly, run `iambic apply` to complete the rename process.
