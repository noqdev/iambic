title: Delete a resource

## The deleted tag
To delete a resource under IAMbic's control, we can use the `deleted` attribute and set it to true.

Consider this example resource bedfore the `deleted: true` tag is set:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
included_accounts:
  - demo-1
identifier: demoRole1
properties:
  description: Role created by user@example.com through Noq
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action: sts:AssumeRole
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          service: ec2.amazonaws.com
    version: '2012-10-17'
  managed_policies:
    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSHealthFullAccess
  role_name: demoRole1
  tags:
    - key: noq-authorized
      value: ''
    - key: noq-authorized-demo
      value: user@example.com
    - key: noq-authorized-demo-cli
      value: ''
```
In order to delete this role, you would add `deleted: true` underneath the `template_type`. Note that it doesn't matter where the `deleted: true` tag is set, as long as it is at the top-level of the YAML context, essentially the same level as the `template_type` attribute.

Here is the example with the `deleted: true` tag set:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
deleted: true
included_accounts:
  - demo-1
identifier: demoRole1
properties:
  description: Role created by user@example.com through Noq
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action: sts:AssumeRole
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          service: ec2.amazonaws.com
    version: '2012-10-17'
  managed_policies:
    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSHealthFullAccess
  role_name: demoRole1
  tags:
    - key: noq-authorized
      value: ''
    - key: noq-authorized-demo
      value: user@example.com
    - key: noq-authorized-demo-cli
      value: ''
```

In order to apply, we run `iambic apply`
Note that you can request applying only the changes in this template file by specifying it by name: `iambic apply resouces/aws/demo-1/demo1usertobedeleted.yaml`
You need to change the path to the template after the `-t` flag to reflect your environemnt.
