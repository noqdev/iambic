IAMbic is an open-source utility and framework that simplifies the process of monitoring and managing Cloud IAM for AWS, Okta, and Google. The core objectives of Iambic are as follows:

1. Allow users to easily understand and manage human and cloud identities, as well as their permissions, in one place.
2. Provide breakglass and JIT access to cloud identities
3. Change access and permissions through familiar pull request flows
4. Easily Round-trip IAM configuration from multi-account AWS or identity providers at any time.
