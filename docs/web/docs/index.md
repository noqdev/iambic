IAMbic is a multi-cloud identity and access management (IAM) control plane that allows you to view and manage your human identities from Okta and Google, and your AWS cloud identities (IAM roles, and SSO permission sets) in a single location.

IAMbic creates a centralized, organized copy of your cloud identities in version control and keeps this copy updated with any changes from your cloud environment, making it easy to audit changes over time. IAMbic intelligently groups similar identities across accounts, allowing for variations in policies or access rules for each defined identity.

IAMbic also lets you manage changes to your cloud IAM configuration. It supports temporary access, permissions, and breakglass flows for end-users. With IAMbic, you have a single source of truth that ties together human identities, cloud identities, cloud permissions, and the relationships between them.

The Noq Platform builds on top of IAMbic to provide user-friendly self-service request flows, access reviews, and unused permissions removal.
