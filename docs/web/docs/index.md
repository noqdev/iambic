IAMbic is an open-source language that simplifies the process of monitoring and managing Cloud IAM for AWS, Okta, and Google. The core objectives of Iambic are as follows:

1. Allow users to easily understand and manage human and cloud identities, as well as their permissions, in one place.
2. Provide breakglass and JIT access to cloud identities
3. Change access and permissions with a single pull request
4. Round-trip configurations from Cloud to Config at any time
