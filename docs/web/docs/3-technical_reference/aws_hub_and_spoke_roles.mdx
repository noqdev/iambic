title: AWS Hub and Spoke Roles
---

IAMbic uses a Hub-and-Spoke model to manage AWS. If you configure IAMbic with AWS Organizations,
your AWS Organizations Management Account will serve as the Hub account.
If you configure IAMbic with individual AWS accounts, you will need to specify the account that will
serve as the Hub account. The `IambicHubRole` will be created on this account. The `IambicSpokeRole` role will be created
on all of your AWS accounts (including the Hub account), and it will be assumed by the `IambicHubRole` to perform actions on the accounts.
