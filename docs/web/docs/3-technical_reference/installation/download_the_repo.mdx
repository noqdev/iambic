## Downloading Git

Follow the instructions on the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to download and install Git on your operating system.

## Checkout the IAMbic repository
1. Go to the [IAMbic repository](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic) to check it out.
1. Copy the URL of the repository. You can do this by clicking the "Clone or download" button and copying the URL that is displayed.
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to checkout the repository.
1. Run one of the following commands to clone IAMbic locally:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/noqdev/iambic
```

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:noqdev/iambic.git
```


This will create a new directory in the current directory with the same name as the repository and checkout the repository to that directory.

You can now make changes to the files in the repository and commit them using Git. Be sure to read the repository's README file or documentation for any additional instructions on how to use the repository.

## Use IAMbic from the local repository

Create a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html) or python environment into which you'd like to install IAMbic. You might reference [install via the wheel](/technical_reference/installation/install_via_the_wheel) methods 1, 2 and 3 for more information on setting up your environment.

Install poetry: `pip install poetry`

Use poetry to install all dependencies - from within the IAMbic repository: `poetry install`

Install IAMbic in development mode: `pip install -e .`
