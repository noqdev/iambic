# What is IAMbic?

IAMbic shifts cloud permissions left by solving the distributed permissions nightmare across multi-cloud environments.
You can think of IAMbic like Terraform, but specifically designed for distributed Cloud IAM.

Imagine that you're a cloud administrator, cloud security engineer, or site reliability engineer for a
company with a large, multi-account footprint across
AWS, GCP, or Azure. You have a lot of different teams across different departments that need access
to different resources on these accounts. You're responsible for managing their permissions and access.

You've shifted left, and you're using a mixture of Terraform, CloudFormation, and ClickOps© to manage your infrastructure.
This approach is great for developers, who review and approve each others' changes. But for you and your security and compliance teams,
it's a nightmare. Developers are being granted excessive permissions, making production changes that no one saw coming,
which is causing accidental breakage left and right. It is also drastically increasing the risk and scope of a potential security breach.

You've lost track of all the different ways that permissions are managed across your organization,
and it's hard to know who has access to what without logging in to multiple systems. You're constantly having to chase down permissions requests,
and you're constantly having to audit your environment to make sure that everything is secure.

That's where IAMbic comes in. IAMbic imports your existing human identities, cloud identities,
and permissions, using a human-readable syntax. You can manage your policies across all your cloud providers and services
from a single codebase, making it easier to reason about and manage
permissions and access controls across different teams and departments, along with dynamic naming and permissions depending on
cloud account. You can also still leverage Infrastructure-as-Code and ClickOps, to have the best of both worlds. IAMbic will
keep track of everything.

IAMbic is a plugin-based multi-cloud identity and access management (IAM) control plane that allows you to view and manage your
AWS cloud identities (IAM roles, and SSO permission sets), and your human identities from Okta and Google
in a single location. IAMbic will be extended to support additional cloud providers in the future, and we welcome contributions
from the community.


# How does it work?

IAMbic creates a centralized, organized, complete copy of your human and cloud identities, principals, and permissions
in version control and keeps this copy updated with any changes from your cloud environment.
This central record makes it easy to audit changes over time. IAMbic intelligently groups similar
identities across accounts, allowing for dynamic definitions of policies or access rules depending on context
(e.g. AWS accounts).

IAMbic also lets you manage changes to your identities, access rules, and permissions. It facilitates
temporary access, group memberships, IAM permissions, and breakglass flows for end-users.
With IAMbic, you have a single source of truth that ties together human identities, cloud identities,
cloud permissions, and the relationships among them.

## Why IAMbic?

Modern, cloud-first companies have empowered employees with an unprecedented level of freedom and control
through shifting left, adopting the cloud, and countless SaaS products. However, as an unintended side effect,
security and compliance teams have lost both control and visibility regarding who has access
to what within their organization.

The impact of this problem is that security and compliance teams face increased risks,
including data breaches and non-compliance with regulations. This can lead to damage to company
reputation, loss of trust among customers, and significant financial penalties. The lack of visibility
and control also creates inefficiencies, as security and compliance teams struggle to keep up with
the volume of changes, access requests, and difficulties in auditing their systems. This results in a
decreased ability to respond to changing business needs and a decreased ability to secure their cloud
environments.

IAMbic's approach to regaining control over cloud permissions and access management is to provide a system
of record that has the necessary depth into custom permission frameworks (i.e. The 7 layers and
13,000 actions in AWS policy language) and breadth (i.e. downstream SaaS applications) to meet the
needs of modern enterprises. This system of record, a modern cloud enterprise directory, combines
records of SSO and cloud identity into one central location, as well as tracking all related permissions
for those identities. This comprehensive record enables cross-account management, and provides a single
source of truth for permissions.

IAMbic intends to standardize the request workflow across the organization, enabling self-serve access
requests in the developer workflow, and standardized request justification for various scenarios, such as
break-glass access. Approvals for shared access are integrated into the Git workflow, providing a streamlined
and efficient process for managing cloud permissions.

## What is the difference between IAMbic and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)?

IAMbic is complementary to Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). It's fine to operate with both in parallel, but we recommend
not managing the same resources with both IAMbic and IaC. IAMbic will automatically capture changes made via IaC or other methods, and store
them as commits in Git, giving you a clear timeline of when permissions were changed, what the changes were, and (in supported cases) who
made the changes.

Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is a way for developers to manage their infrastructure, but it comes with its own challenges.
IaC promotes decentralization by project, meaning it's hard to get a full picture of your environment's existing configuration
in a single place. Additionally, as the complexity of IaC code and custom Terraform modules increases and becomes spread
across multiple accounts and providers, the level of effort required for security practitioners to track the configuration
goes up quickly. And finally, there can be a drift between the code and the actual state of your cloud environment, making IaC less of a useful artifact for understanding the current state of the cloud.

That's where IAMbic comes in. IAMbic is designed specifically to help manage permissions, and centralize them into a
single Git repository in a human-readable format. IAMbic also includes Github actions that keep your permissions
updated with the actual state of your cloud environments and identity providers. This way, you can have a complete
and current picture of your permissions.

IAMbic can take this a step further by letting you manage some or all of your permissions, working seamlessly
alongside your existing Infrastructure-as-Code or ClickOps workflows.
The IAMbic format is designed to be simple and human-readable, making it easy for anyone to understand and make changes to your
permissions. And because IAMbic is stateless, you can make small changes quickly and easily.

In summary, while IaC is great for managing infrastructure, IAMbic is designed specifically to manage permissions
and provide a complete and mutable representation of your permissions in one central location.
