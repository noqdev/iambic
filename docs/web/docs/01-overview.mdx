# Introduction
IAMbic is a multi-cloud identity and access management (IAM) control plane that allows you to view and manage your
AWS cloud identities (IAM roles, and SSO permission sets), and your human identities from Okta and Google
in a single location.

IAMbic creates a centralized, organized, complete copy of your human and cloud identities, principals, and permissions
in version control and keeps this copy updated with any changes from your cloud environment.
This central record makes it easy to audit changes over time. IAMbic intelligently groups similar
identities across accounts, allowing for dynamic definitions of policies or access rules depending on context
(e.g. AWS accounts).

IAMbic also lets you manage changes to your identities, access rules, and permissions. It facilitates
temporary access, group memberships, IAM permissions, and breakglass flows for end-users.
With IAMbic, you have a single source of truth that ties together human identities, cloud identities,
cloud permissions, and the relationships among them.

The Noq Platform is built on top of IAMbic to provide user-friendly self-service request flows,
access reviews, and unused permissions removal.

## Why IAMbic?

Modern, cloud-first companies have empowered employees with an unprecedented level of freedom and control
through shifting left, adopting the cloud, and countless SaaS products. However, as an unintended side effect,
security and compliance teams have lost both control and visibility regarding who has access
to what within their organization.

The impact of this problem is that security and compliance teams face increased risks,
including data breaches and non-compliance with regulations. This can lead to damage to company
reputation, loss of trust among customers, and significant financial penalties. The lack of visibility
and control also creates inefficiencies, as security and compliance teams struggle to keep up with
the volume of access requests and the difficulties in auditing their systems. This results in a
decreased ability to respond to changing business needs and a decreased ability to secure their cloud
environments.

### The Solution

IAMbic's approach to regaining control over cloud entitlements and access management is to provide a system
of record that has the necessary depth into custom permission frameworks (i.e. The 7 layers and
13,000 actions in AWS policy language) and breadth (i.e. downstream SaaS applications) to meet the
needs of modern enterprises. This system of record, a modern cloud enterprise directory, combines
records of SSO and cloud identity into one central location, as well as tracking all related entitlements
for those identities. This comprehensive record enables cross-account management, and providing a single
source of truth for entitlements.

IAMbic intends to standardize the request workflow across the organization, enabling self-serve access
requests in the developer workflow, and standardizing request justification for various scenarios, such as
break-glass access. Approvals for shared access are integrated into the Git workflow, providing a streamlined
and efficient process for managing cloud entitlements.
