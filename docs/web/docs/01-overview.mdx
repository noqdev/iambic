IAMbic is a multi-cloud identity and access management (IAM) control plane that allows you to view and manage your AWS cloud identities (IAM roles, and SSO permission sets), and your human identities from Okta and Google in a single location.

IAMbic creates a centralized, organized, complete copy of your human and cloud identities <!-- #TODO is "identities" a broad enough characterization? --> in version control and keeps this copy updated with any changes from your cloud environment. This central record makes it easy to audit changes over time. IAMbic intelligently groups similar identities across accounts, allowing for variations in policies or access rules for each defined identity.

IAMbic also lets you manage changes to your identities, access rules, and permissions. It facilitates temporary access, group memberships, IAM permissions, and breakglass flows for end-users. With IAMbic, you have a single source of truth that ties together human identities, cloud identities, cloud permissions, and the relationships among them.

The Noq Platform is built on top of IAMbic to provide user-friendly self-service request flows, access reviews, and unused permissions removal.

Iambic is so simple, even a developer can use it!
