## Getting Started

This page will guide you through setting up the required technologies that will allow you to run IAMbic.

### Set up a Git repository

You'll need to create a dedicated Git repository. If you're just trying out IAMbic, create a [local Git repository](./installation/local_git_repo).
When you're ready to deploy IAMbic, create a [Github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).
GitHub is preferable because Noq provides [Github workflows](./integrations/github) that keep IAM entitlements updated within your repository.

Now you are ready to use IAMbic - follow the instructions in the next step "Using IAMbic".

### Using IAMbic

#### Configure IAM credentials

Configure AWS credentials before running IAMbic. You can accomplish this by either setting environment variables with your credentials, setting an AWS_PROFILE, or another supported method.
Please reference the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) for more details.

#### Docker

The easiest way to get started with IAMbic is through Docker and alias `iambic` to the docker command. This will allow you to run IAMbic from anywhere on your system.

Follow these instructions to set up the Alias depending on your shell. Be sure to replace `<local_dir\>` with the location of
the git repository that you created earlier to store your templates.

Bash:

```bash
echo 'alias iambic="docker run -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v ${HOME}/.aws:/app/.aws -e AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/app/.aws/config -e AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/app/.aws/credentials -e "AWS_PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE}" -v <local_dir\>:/templates:Z public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest "$@""' >> ~/.bashrc
```

ZSH:

```zsh
echo 'alias iambic="docker run -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v ${HOME}/.aws:/app/.aws -e AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/app/.aws/config -e AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/app/.aws/credentials -e "AWS_PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE}" -v <local_dir\>:/templates:Z public.ecr.aws/s2p9s3r8/iambic:latest "$@""' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Please reference the [IAMbic and Docker](./installation/install_via_docker) section for more details on using the IAMbic docker container.

Test whether you can run IAMbic: `iambic --help`

> More information: if you want more information on installing the [docker container](./installation/install_via_docker), you can also [install the wheel](./installation/install_via_the_wheel) or [check out the repo](./installation/download_the_repo).

### Configuring IAMbic

Run `iambic setup` command to launch the [Configuration Wizard](./configuration/using_the_wizard). Alternatively, you can [create the configuration by hand](./configuration/create_the_configuration).


### Next Steps

Now that you have IAMbic installed, you're ready to move on to the next steps. At this point, your experience will vary depending on the goals you want to achieve:

- [Continue with AWS](./integrations/aws)
- [Continue with Okta](./integrations/okta)
- [Continue with Google](./integrations/google)
