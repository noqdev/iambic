### Licensing Policy

IAMbic is licensed with AGPLv3. IAMBic plugins are licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0.

Our purpose in choosing AGPL v3.0 as our open source license is to ensure that any improvements made to IAMbic are shared with the community.
This is because the traditional GPL license is no longer effective for a large amount of cloud-based software.

To encourage contributions for proprietary providers, our provider plugins are made available under the Apache License v2.0.
You are also free to write plugins for internal providers without needing to open source the plugin code.

If the use of our plugins under the Apache License v2.0 or IAMbic core under the AGPLv3 does not meet the legal requirements
of your organization (as some may not accept the GPL in any form), commercial licenses are available through Noq Software.
Please reach out to us for more information at legal@noq.dev.

### Noq Trademark Guidelines

IAMbic, Noq, and the Noq logo are registered trademarks of Noq Software, Inc..
For trademark use approval or any questions you have about using these trademarks, please email trademark@noq.dev.
