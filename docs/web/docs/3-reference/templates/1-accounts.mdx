title: AWS Account Template Examples
---

An example AWS account specification that is tied to an organization via its id, has a distinct spoke role arn assigned to it, and role access definitions:
```yaml
  - default_region: us-east-1
    spoke_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/IambicSpokeRole
    account_id: '123456789012'
    org_id: o-ybe1r90sq
    account_name: development
```

An example AWS account specification that is not tied to an organization and does not have specific role access definitions.
```yaml
  - default_region: us-east-1
    spoke_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::456789012345:role/IambicSpokeRole
    account_id: '456789012345'
    account_name: staging
```
