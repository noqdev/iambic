Template Language
-----------------

IAMbic's powerful templatizing feature allows you to use double curly brackets to
reference attributes. The backend employs Jinja2 templating to load each template
and apply the following variables:

* `account_name`: always set to the name of the account being processed.
* `account_id`: always set to the account ID of the account being processed.

In addition to the hard-coded references always available for substitutions, you
can define your own variables to be substituted for each account.

For example, the AwsAccount model, which defines AWS accounts:

```
class AwsAccount:
    account_id
    org_id
    account_name
    partition
    variables
    hub_session_info
    identity_center_details
    spoke_role_arn
```

has an optional variables field that can store a list of Variable model objects. Each Variable
model object is a simple object that declares a key and a value:

```
class Variable:
    key
    value
```

Specifying dedicated variables for each account enables customization of templates for each account.

Here's an example of an AWS role and how to templatize it with IAMbic:

```
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
identifier: '{{account_name}}_readonly'
properties:
  description: Standard ReadOnly Role
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action:
          - sts:AssumeRole
          - sts:TagSession
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          aws: arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:role/IambicHubRole
      - action:
          - sts:AssumeRole
          - sts:TagSession
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          aws: arn:aws:iam::4567890123456:role/NoqCentralRoleCorpNoqDev
    version: '2012-10-17'
  managed_policies:
    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::{{account_id}}:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
  role_name: '{{account_name}}_readonly'
  tags:
    - key: noq-tra-supported-groups
      value: noq_admins@noq.dev

```

In the example above, we use the {{account_name}} placeholder to dynamically set the identifier and role_name
fields for each account managed by IAMbic. If IAMbic manages 10 accounts, this role would exist in all ten accounts.

For a closer look, let's examine the first few accounts and their templatized role identifiers using the {{account_name}} substitution:

1. prod:
    identifier: prod_readonly
    ...
2. dev:
    identifier: dev_readonly
    ...
3. staging:
    identifier: staging_readonly
    ...

Templatizing each template ensures the presence of a group resource or any resource across a set of accounts.
To control which account has the role, use the included_accounts and excluded_accounts attributes.
