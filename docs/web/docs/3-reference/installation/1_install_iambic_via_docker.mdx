## Running the IAMbic docker container locally

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following tools installed on your system:

* Docker ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

### Steps

> Note: for instructions on how to use IAMbic, reference [Using IAMbic](/reference/using_iambic)

To run the docker container locally, you can use the docker command:

Basic run:

    docker run public.ecr.aws/iambic/iambic:latest <command>

We recommend mounting a local volume for the templates that are imported:

    docker run -it -v <local_dir>:/templates public.ecr.aws/iambic/iambic:latest <command>

If you want to run IAMbic from the current directory, you can use a BASH trick to get the current working directory:

    docker run -it -v ${pwd}:/templates public.ecr.aws/iambic/iambic:latest <command>

It is best to run as the current user to make sure that templates written to disk are written in the user and group currently active on the host:

    docker run -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v ${pwd}:/templates public.ecr.aws/iambic/iambic:latest <command>

Optionally you can store the volume in your system's docker context - be forwarned that the docker context could be coerced to delete the volume without warning using a command like `docker system prune` - it is generally best to store templates on your hard drive in a place where the chances of accidental deletion are minimized:

    docker run -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v /templates public.ecr.aws/iambic/iambic:latest <command>

Depending on where your cloud credentials are stored, you may have to mount the relevant directory inside the docker container as well:

    docker run -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v ${HOME}/.aws:/app/.aws -e AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/app/.aws/config -e AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/app/.aws/credentials -e "AWS_PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE}" -v ${pwd}:/templates:Z public.ecr.aws/iambic/iambic:latest <command>

### Shortcut

We recommend that you add the following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile:

```bash
echo 'alias iambic="docker run -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v ${HOME}/.aws:/app/.aws -e AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/app/.aws/config -e AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/app/.aws/credentials -e "AWS_PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE}" -v <local_dir\>:/templates:Z public.ecr.aws/iambic/iambic:latest <command>"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```zsh
echo 'alias iambic="docker run -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v ${HOME}/.aws:/app/.aws -e AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/app/.aws/config -e AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/app/.aws/credentials -e "AWS_PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE}" -v <local_dir\>:/templates:Z public.ecr.aws/iambic/iambic:latest <command>"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

That way you can just execute iambic seamlessly as an application within your system:

    iambic import

## Installing the IAMbic docker container with your Github Actions

You can automate your workflows by installing the IAMbic docker container with your Github Actions flow.

Reference [IAMbic on Github](/getting_started/github) for more information.

## Building the IAMbic docker container

You can also build your own IAMbic docker container by cloning the IAMbic repo and following the below steps:

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need to have the following tools installed on your system:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

If you don't have these tools installed, follow the instructions below:

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps

#### Clone the IAMbic repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noqdev/iambic.git
```

#### Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd iambic/
```

```bash
docker build -t your-username/project-name:tag .
```

Replace your-username/project-name:tag with the name you want to give your Docker image. For example, johnsmith/my-project:v1.0.0. The . at the end of the command specifies that the Dockerfile is located in the current directory.

#### Test the Docker image.

Run the following command to start a Docker container using the image you just built:

```bash
docker run your-username/project-name:tag <command>
```

This command starts the container using the Docker image you just built.

You should be able to start the documentation server by typing: `docker run your-username/project-name:tag doc_serve`. Then try to access this documentation resource on http://localhost:3000.

#### Push the Docker image to Docker Hub or a private repository.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a popular registry for storing and sharing Docker images. If you don't have a Docker Hub account, sign up for one.

Alternatively, publish the docker image to a repository of your choice.

If you choose to store the docker image in docker hub...

Login:

```bash
docker login
```

This command will prompt you to enter your Docker Hub username and password.

Once you're logged in, run the following command to push the Docker image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push your-username/project-name:tag
```

This command uploads the Docker image to Docker Hub, where it can be accessed by other users.
