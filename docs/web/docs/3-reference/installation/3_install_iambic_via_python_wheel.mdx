## Pre-requisites

## Install Python if you have not already

To download IAMbic from PyPI, you will need to ensure that Python is installed on your machine. Here are two methods for installing Python:

### Method 1: Python

1. Go to the [Python Downloads page]( https://www.python.org/downloads) and download and install Python 3.10 or later.
1. Create a virtual environment and install IAMbic by running the following commands:

```bash
# Create a directory for your iambic templates if you didn't already create one
mkdir iambic-templates
cd iambic-templates

# Create a virtual environment to store iambic and its dependencies
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate

# Install IAMbic
pip install iambic-core
```

Test by running `iambic --help`

### Method 2: Use pyenv (Recommended for managing multiple versions of Python)

1. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) by following the instructions on their GitHub page. (`brew install pyenv` on Mac)
1. Install [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) by following the instructions on their GitHub page. (`brew install pyenv-virtualenv` on Mac)
1. Create a virtual environment and install IAMbic by running the following commands:

```bash
# Install the desired version of Python (replace 3.10 with your desired version).
pyenv install 3.10
# Set the Python version globally with `pyenv global 3.10` or locally within a folder with `pyenv local 3.10`.
pyenv local 3.10
# Create a virtual environment (replace 3.10 and iambic with your desired version and environment name).
pyenv virtualenv 3.10 iambic
# Activate the virtual environment
pyenv activate iambic
# Install IAMbic
pip install iambic-core
```

Test by running `iambic --help`
