# IAMOps Philosophy

## GitOps

[GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) is a modern approach to managing
and maintaining software infrastructure
through version-controlled code repositories like Git. It combines development best
practices, such as version control and automated testing, with operations tasks
like deployment and monitoring. In a nutshell, GitOps makes it easy for developers
and operations teams to collaborate and maintain infrastructure by treating it as code.

## IAMOps

IAMOps, or Identity and Access Management Operations, takes the GitOps concept and
applies it to managing cloud identities and permissions. It focuses on centralizing and
streamlining the tracking and management of cloud identities, access rules and
user permissions using Git as the source of truth. This way, developers, operations,
security, and compliance teams can work together more efficiently,
applying the same best practices they use for code development to manage access and
permissions across different cloud platforms.

## Iambic

IAMbic uses Git to keep track of changes in your cloud permissions and configurations.
By using Git's branching and commit history, IAMbic can easily spot differences in your
cloud settings without having to make time-consuming requests to your cloud provider.

### Iambic Import Process

The IAMbic import process grabs updates from your cloud environment and puts them
into your Git repository. IAMbic comes with GitHub actions that run on a schedule to
automatically import changes from your cloud environment. If you want, you can also
run the import process manually.

### Iambic Apply Process

The apply process is where the magic happens. When you make changes to your
IAMbic templates, get them approved through Git, and issue the secret command in your
pull request (`iambic apply`), IAMbic will figure out what updates are needed in
your cloud to match your new desired state. Then, it'll go ahead and apply those changes.
