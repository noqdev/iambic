During development, create a virtual environment and install the project via poetry.

```console
python -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install poetry
poetry install --with dev
```

To ensure any changes not introducing regression, please run `make test` within the virtual environment
with the project installed.

```console
# if you are not in an virtual environment already, source it
# . env/bin/activate
make test
```

`test` target will execute the unit tests that have no dependnecy on cloud resources.

`functional_test` target will execute the functional tests with dependency on specific cloud resources.
External developers have no access to them. Please defer to mintainers to verify functional tests.
These functional tests will be run via Github Actions.
